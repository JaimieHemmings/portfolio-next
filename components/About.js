        <span></span>Hello! I'm Jaimie, a seasoned web developer with years of
        experience working with a wide array of JavaScript frameworks and
        libraries. Over the years, I've honed my skills at several dynamic
        agencies, where I've brought countless digital projects to life. When
        I'm not coding, you can find me capturing moments through my camera
        lens, strumming away on my guitar, or creating serene underwater
        landscapes through aquascaping. Whether it's crafting a beautiful
        website or a beautiful aquarium, I'm passionate about making things that
        people love.
